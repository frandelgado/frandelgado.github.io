For the past several months now I've been logging all of my spendings, the general idea was to be a bit more organized with my sending and, if possible, extract some insights about them.  

So now, after all these months the opportunity presented itself. This post in part constitutes a university project for the subject "Visualización de la información". The objective is to gather personal data and present a visualization that is hopefuly usefull. With that said, lets go through how I explored the data.

The data itself was quite easily to extract, I just exported the logs from my mobile phone app and removed some useless columns. All in all I had all my expenses, each with its own timestamp, ammount and category. 

My first approach was to try and understand how my spending evolved over the month. Naturally my first approach was to plot a cummulative spending graph in whcich I could track how the month's expenses grew with time. which I plotted with the use of Tablau immediately below.

The first thing that surprised me is that if I divide my spending is remarkably linear. In fact, if I remove my swing class (catalogued under Active sport) and home improvement purchases (catalogued unde Improvements), which are rather "one off" things, I find the linearity even stronger. For some reason I tend to spend money in a linear fashion.

With this said, I wanted to dig a little deeper and find outiler spending logs, for this a boxplot was ideal. To be frank the only category to plot that brought some insight was the "Food & Drinks" Category which had a susbstantial ammount of entries. What was interesting about it is that I spend on average 334 ARS per meal, this taking into account the outlier spending which took place on march 8th.

With this visualizations and analysis I was able to understand what my money is being spent on. I was able to identify outliers which allowed me to put them in perspective and better judge if they were "money well spent".

To close this post i'd like to note some things I would like to futher analyse, firstly I would like to understand how my spending on the weekdays compares to those on the weekends. Also how my daytime spending compares to my nighttime spending. I expect my nighttime spending to be less frequent but bigger sums. 

Finally, I would like to do a yearly analysis, which will alow me to view other patterns from more sparse spending categories such as Fitness, Courses and Improvements. So stay tuned, I might write a continuation article!
